        <p>9.2 <strong>LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.</strong> Subject to section 9.3 (“exclusions”), in no event will your or our (or our affiliates’, contractors’, employees’, agents’, or third-party partners’, licensors’, or suppliers’) total cumulative liability to the other party for all damages, losses, and causes of action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or your use of the Services, Site, or any other products or Services provided in connection with this Agreement, including without limitation your interactions with other users, (whether in contract, tort including negligence, warranty, or otherwise) exceed the amount paid or payable by you, if any, for accessing the Services during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the day the act or omission occurred that gave rise to your claim or one thousand u.s. dollars ($1,000), whichever is greater.</p>

        <p>9.4 <strong>LIMITATIONS ARE A BASIS OF THE BARGAIN.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that we have offered our Services, and entered into this Agreement, in reliance upon the disclaimers of warranty and the limitations of liability set forth herein, that the disclaimers of warranty and the limitations of liability set forth herein reflect a reasonable and fair allocation of risk between you and us (including the risk that a contract remedy may fail of its essential purpose and cause consequential loss), and that the disclaimers of warranty and the limitations of liability set forth herein form an essential basis of the bargain between you and us, without which the economic terms of this Agreement would be different.</p>

        <div class="big-text">10. SERVICES LOCATION; EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.</div>

        <p>The Services are controlled and operated from our facilities in the United States. We make no representations that the Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations.

We will notify you in a reasonably prompt manner of claims, suits, actions, or proceedings for which we are seeking the above indemnification, provided that failure to so notify will not relieve you of your obligations except to the extent your ability to defend the claim, suit, action or proceeding is prejudiced by the delay. You may use counsel of your choosing (subject to our written approval). Any settlement requiring us to admit liability or to pay any money will require our prior written consent; and we may join in the defense and participate in any settlement discussions with our own counsel at our own expense.</p>

        <p>(a) <strong>Details.</strong> The arbitration will be governed by the then-current terms of the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "Rules") of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") and will be held with a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules. The award of the arbitrator will be based on the evidence admitted and the substantive law of the State of California and the United States, as applicable, and will contain an award for each issue and counterclaim. The award will provide in writing the factual findings and legal reasoning for such award. The arbitrator will not be entitled to modify the terms of this Agreement. Except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the arbitration award will be final and binding on the parties. Judgment may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party will be entitled to obtain a copy of non-privileged relevant documents in the possession or control of the other party and to take a reasonable number of depositions. All such discovery will be in accordance with procedures approved by the arbitrator. This Section 8.3 does not alter in any way the statute of limitations that would apply to any claims or counterclaims asserted by either party. Under this Arbitration provision, both parties hereby give up the right to resolve any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement by a judge and/or a jury. Prior to filing any arbitration, both parties jointly agree to seek to resolve any dispute between us by mediation conducted by the AAA, with all mediator fees and expenses paid equally by the parties.</p>

        <p>Each party also agrees not to participate as a class representative or class member in any class action litigation, any class arbitration or any consolidation of individual arbitrations against each other. The parties specifically agree to the binding nature of the arbitration.</p>

        <p>(b) <strong>Injunctive Relief.</strong> Notwithstanding any provision in this Section to the contrary, Legion Analytics may seek injunctive relief in any court having jurisdiction over the parties to enjoin or prevent any action you take or threaten to take in violation of the terms of this Agreement.</p>

        <p>(c) <strong>Individual Basis.</strong> Only It is the intent of the parties to require any claims or controversies between them to be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only.

        <p>13.2 <strong>WAIVER.</strong> The failure of either party to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by the waiving party.</p>

        <p>13.3 <strong>REMEDIES.</strong> Your and our respective rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative. You acknowledge that the Services and Legion Analytics Technology contain our valuable trade secrets and proprietary information, that any breach of this Agreement relating thereto will constitute harm to us for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and that injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy.</p>

        <p>13.4 <strong>SEVERABILITY; INTERPRETATION.</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the limitation of liability provisions will remain in effect notwithstanding any unenforceability of any warranty or warranty disclaimer provision. Any list of examples following “including” or “e.g.,” is illustrative and not exhaustive, unless qualified by terms such as “only” or “solely.” All references (e.g., to sections, parties, terms, and attachments) are to the sections of, parties to, terms of, and attachments to this Agreement, unless expressly indicated otherwise. All captions are intended solely for your and our respective convenience, and none will affect the meaning of any provision. All references to “written,” “in writing,” or other words of similar import refer to a non-electronic, paper document only, except where electronic mail communication is expressly authorized.</p>

        <p>13.5 <strong>ASSIGNMENT.</strong> This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without our prior written consent (which may be withheld in our sole discretion), but may be assigned by us without restriction. Any permitted assignment of this Agreement will be binding upon and enforceable by and against your and our respective successors and assigns, provided that any unauthorized attempted assignment will be null and void and constitute a breach of this Agreement.</p>

        <p>13.6 <strong>USE OF SUBCONTRACTORS.</strong> We will have sole authority in determining the method of operating and maintaining the Services, including the right to subcontract any or all of its responsibilities and obligations; provided, however, that we will remain responsible for our obligations hereunder.</p>

        <p>13.7 <strong>U.S. GOVERNMENT RIGHTS.</strong> The Services are “commercial items,” as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227. 7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government users acquire only those rights in the Services that are provided in this Agreement.</p>

        <p>13.8 <strong>FORCE MAJEURE.</strong> We will not be liable to you or your Users for delays, failures, or inadequate performance that results from conditions outside of our reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, natural disasters, systemic electrical, telecommunications, or other utility failures, earthquakes, threatened or actual acts of terrorism or war, riots, or governmental acts or orders.</p>

        <p>13.9 <strong>INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS; THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES.</strong> You and we are independent contractors, and nothing herein will be construed as creating a partnership, agency, or joint venture, and neither you nor we will have the ability to bind the other. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement.</p>

        <p>13.10 <strong>PUBLICITY.</strong> If you are a company, you hereby grant to us the right to use your company’s name, trademarks, and logos solely for purposes of identifying and promoting your company as a client of ours during the term of this Agreement and thereafter. Further, we will have the right to issue a press release regarding the existence of the business relationship between you and us.</p>

        <p>13.11 <strong>ENTIRE AGREEMENT.</strong> This Agreement, together with all incorporated documents and any additional agreements you may enter into with us in connection with the Services, constitutes the entire agreement between you and us relating to the subject matter herein, and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions, or agreements, whether written or oral, between you and us regarding its subject matter. This Agreement can only be modified in a writing signed by you and us, collectively. Signatures sent by electronic means (facsimile or scanned and sent via e-mail) will be deemed original signatures.
